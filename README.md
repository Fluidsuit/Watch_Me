🎬 Watch Me – Streaming Web Application

Watch Me is a full-stack streaming web application , built using JSP, Servlets, and JDBC for backend development and a modern responsive frontend designed with React, Tailwind CSS, and Bootstrap.
The application allows users to explore movies and TV shows dynamically fetched from The Movie Database (TMDB) API, providing a smooth and engaging streaming-like experience.
The project follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture to maintain clean separation between the presentation layer (JSP), business logic (Servlets), and database operations (JDBC). 
User interactions such as login, registration, and managing a personalized watchlist are securely handled through JDBC connections to a MySQL database.
On the frontend, React is used to handle the UI components efficiently, while Tailwind CSS and Bootstrap ensure a responsive and modern look across all devices. 
The integration of REST API enables real-time data fetching for displaying popular movies, trending content, and now-playing titles with dynamic posters and descriptions. 
Users can easily browse, search, and filter through various categories, enhancing the overall user experience.
The backend, developed in Eclipse IDE, efficiently manages requests, session tracking, and database transactions, ensuring data consistency and security.
The frontend, created in VS Code, consumes the API endpoints and displays data interactively.
